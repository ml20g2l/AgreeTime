# AgreeTime

**AgreeTime** is a collaborative scheduling app that helps groups manage their time transparently and fairly.  
Whether you're planning a family trip, organising a school project, or scheduling meetups with friends, AgreeTime ensures that all participants **agree** before anything is confirmed.

## Purpose

- Promote respectful time management among family, friends, or teammates
- Prevent overlapping or one-sided scheduling
- Ensure fair and unanimous decision-making through an approval-based system

## Key Features

- **Event Registration**  
  Create events by specifying what, when, where, and who’s involved

- **Approval-Based Confirmation**  
  Events involving multiple people require unanimous approval from selected approvers

- **Notifications**  
  Participants and approvers receive real-time alerts upon event creation or update

- **Conflict Prevention**  
  Automatically blocks overlapping events involving the same people

- **Shared Calendar**  
  All confirmed events are displayed in a unified calendar for all users
